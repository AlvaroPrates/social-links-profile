## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Basic CSS, Flexbox and Media Queries

### What I learned

As this project has specific layout requirements for various devices, I have started learning about `rem` units and the `max-width` CSS property to enhance page responsiveness. Additionally, I’ve explored media queries to adjust the profile card’s design for different screen sizes.

### Continued development

Now I'm feeling more confortable with basic flexbox.
